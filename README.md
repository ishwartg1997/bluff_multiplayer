# bluff_multiplayer
A Multiplayer Bluff Game using Python, Flask, Jinja2 and JQuery

Flask is used to enhance the web dev process, SQLAlchemy as the ORM and JQuery and HTML to create rich responsive frontends. AJAX and server-side scripting come into play and a REST API endpoint is designed too.

Security is given consideration too through certificates and regex validation to thwart basic attacks like XSS, CRSS and SQL injection attacks. Beyond that, logging is implemented to recover the system if it fails.

This was originally a course project for SWE681 but it was such a cool thing to experiment with and extend further. Next, I plan to 
add chat functionality.

Feel free to let me know if there are any particular features you'd like to see added! After all, this is a programmer's perspective and your experience is best honed by feedback :)
